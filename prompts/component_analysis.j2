Analyze this single-line electrical diagram and identify all electrical components with their specifications. Focus on standard electrical symbols commonly found in power distribution systems.

Please identify the following types of components when present:
- Circuit Breakers (MCB, MCCB, ACB) with current ratings
- Transformers (Power, Current, Voltage) with kVA/VA ratings and voltage levels
- Motors (Induction, Synchronous) with HP/kW ratings
- Generators with capacity ratings
- Switches (Isolators, Load Break, Disconnect)
- Protection devices (Relays, Fuses) with ratings
- Measurement devices (Meters, CTs, PTs)
- Cables and Conductors with specifications
- Busbars and distribution panels
- Capacitors with kVAR ratings
- Any other electrical components visible

For each component identified, provide:
- Component name/designation from the diagram
- Component type/category
- Electrical ratings (voltage, current, power, etc.) if visible
- Quantity count
- Any additional specifications visible on the diagram

Response format should be valid JSON:
[{
  "name": "Component designation or name from diagram",
  "type": "Specific component type (e.g., 'MCCB', '3-Phase Induction Motor', 'Power Transformer')",
  "rating": "Electrical rating with units (e.g., '100A', '500kVA', '15HP')",
  "voltage": "Voltage level if specified (e.g., '415V', '11kV')",
  "quantity": {{ quantity_format | default("number") }},
  "specifications": "Any additional details visible"
}]

Focus on accuracy and only include components that are clearly visible and identifiable in the diagram.
